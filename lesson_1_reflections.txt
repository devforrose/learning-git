How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It saved a lot of work - you din't have to go through line by line comparing both problems.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It's easier to go back to previous versions, before the bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Con is that you can forget. Pro is that you can chose more logical places, and add a message which makes it easier to find.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because when you code you often have several files that make up a program.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
'git log' shows you all commits, and 'git diff old_file new_file' lets you compare files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can go back and find where you introduced a bugg

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For all of my projects and excersizes.
