Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might not always want all the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
You clone when you want to get a local copy. You fork smo elses repo (so you keep the link).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can compare them, and see how to merge them.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be easier to do small changes in small projects, but very difficult with big projects.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you're collaborating with other people on a project.
